                        <p class = "text-white">Interior design and decoration are as crucial for places where a service is availed as it is while planning a house. Any place is marked by the ambience and the feeling it gives us which makes any individual decide whether to visit the place again or not. Such is the service that we offer at Rayon interiors, by creating designs that touch your spirits and make you fall in love with the ambience. Moreover, we also create space based on the service provided at the location. For example, at places like dental hospitals, we use pastel or light colours for the walls and floors that are soothing for patients who may come anxiously to the clinic. We also add calming music which might be relieving from the stress. So, we basically take the comfort of the customers in view. Apart from this we also do restaurants, banquet halls and convention centres which can be customised according to the theme the client has in mind.</p>

                        <p class = "text-white">At Rayon interiors, we believe visualisations make communicating the design easily to the clients. We create an actual 3D representation of your dream project, which is mostly in the form of a two minute video where we take you through a mini tour of every nook and corner of your project. This virtual representation makes the client feel close to reality and this can also shower a promising impact.  The walk throughs that we do are mostly done by professionals who are well versed at 3D designing and animation. Our goal is to give you the best visuals so that it is easier to make alterations even before the design is implied thereby saving cost, effort and time for us and the clients.</p>
